# Shooting For The Stars: A Statistical analysis of the NASA Meteorite dataset
This project is a part of the FlatIron School Data Science Fellowship requirements.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to examine the statistical signifigance of various meteorite properties. This includes things like their mass, classification, and strike coordinates.

## Project Description
This project tests several hypothesis with t-tests and proportions tests
  * Ho: The classification of meteorites has no effect on average mass
  * Ho: The average mass of meteorites found vs. observed falling is the same
  * Ho: No change occurs in the ratio of falling to found meteorites over time
  * Ho: Meteorites land with equal frequency across the global landmass
